Method 1
    With spring security dependency default user is created
    username: "user"
    password: auto-generated, generated password is logged at the time of application startup.

Method 2
    Using application properties
        spring.security.user.name: "srivatsan"
        spring.security.user.password: "password"
        spring.security.user.roles: "ADMIN"

Method 3
    By creating custom InMemoryUserDetailsManager Bean

        UserDetailsService - Core interface which loads user-specific data.
                |
                V
        UserDetailsManager (extends UserDetailsService) - Extension of the UserDetailsService which provides the ability to create new users and update existing ones.
                |
                V
        InMemoryUserDetailsManager (implements UserDetailsManager) - Implementation of UserDetailsManager which is backed by an in-memory map.

    PasswordEncoding
        The default, format for storing the password is : {id}encoded_password
        Storing without encoding: {noop}plain_password
        Storing with encoding: {bcrypt}encoded_password
        By default DelegationPasswordEncoder first checks the format of stored password {id} i.e. {bcrypt},
          so it passes the incoming password to BcryptPasswordEncoder, and after hashing, it does the matching.
        We can define which PasswordEncoder to use directly. Then control will not go to "DelegationPasswordEncoder",
         and it directly goes to specific Password Encoder, so now no need to put {id} in front of password.

Method 4
    Storing UserName and Password (after hashed) in DB
    Uses Spring JPA to store the user data in database.

Form based Authentication
    It’s a stateful authentication method.
        Stateful authentication means, server maintains the user authentication state (aka Session ).
        So that user don’t have to provide username/password every time with each request.

    User enters their credentials (i.e. username/password) in an HTML login form.
    On successful authentication, a session (JSESSIONID) is created to maintain the user authentication state across different requests.
    Now, with subsequent request, client only passes JSESSIONID and not username/password. And server validates it with stored JSESSIONID.

Session Creation Policy
    IF_REQUIRED
        HttpSession is only created when needed(DEFAULT).
        For example:
            public api for which authentication is not required, HTTPSession will not be created if this policy will be chosen.

    ALWAYS
        HttpSession is always created. If already present then use it.
        For example:
            even for public api for which authentication is not required, HTTPSession will be created if this policy will be chosen.

    NEVER
        Do not creates a Session, but use if present.

    STATELESS
        No Session is created, used for Stateless applications.

Disadvantages of Form based authentication:
1. Vulnerable to Security issues like CSRF and Session hijacking. Be default, CSRF is enabled for form based login and we should not disable it.
2. Session Management is big overhead and in case of distributed system it can lead to scalability issue.
3. Database load: if there are multiple servers then we might need to store the session in DB or Cache, which again required memory and lookup time. Which can cause latency issue.
