Method 1
    With spring security dependency default user is created
    username: "user"
    password: auto-generated, generated password is logged at the time of application startup.

Method 2
    Using application properties
        spring.security.user.name: "srivatsan"
        spring.security.user.password: "password"
        spring.security.user.roles: "ADMIN"

Method 3
    By creating custom InMemoryUserDetailsManager Bean

        UserDetailsService - Core interface which loads user-specific data.
                |
                V
        UserDetailsManager (extends UserDetailsService) - Extension of the UserDetailsService which provides the ability to create new users and update existing ones.
                |
                V
        InMemoryUserDetailsManager (implements UserDetailsManager) - Implementation of UserDetailsManager which is backed by an in-memory map.

    PasswordEncoding
        The default, format for storing the password is : {id}encoded_password
        Storing without encoding: {noop}plain_password
        Storing with encoding: {bcrypt}encoded_password
        By default DelegationPasswordEncoder first checks the format of stored password {id} i.e. {bcrypt},
          so it passes the incoming password to BcryptPasswordEncoder, and after hashing, it does the matching.
        We can define which PasswordEncoder to use directly. Then control will not go to "DelegationPasswordEncoder",
         and it directly goes to specific Password Encoder, so now no need to put {id} in front of password.

Method 4
    Storing UserName and Password (after hashed) in DB
